# Vet clinic
> This is database of a vet clinic. I am only making the entries in the sql file. There are currently 3 tables, namely animals, owners and species. 

> This template should be used for database related projects at Microverse.
> Generate your own repository, update this README and edit all files content while working on projects. You should not be adding any new files unless asked otherwise.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## Calculator App

> This is my simple bookstore app. This can be used to add, edit and remove books. There is a section that allows one to update their progress and a form to add more books by category.
